"""You are given a string where you have to find its first word.

When solving a task pay attention to the following points:

There can be dots and commas in a string.
A string can start with a letter or, for example, one/multiple dot(s) or space(s).
A word can contain an apostrophe and it's a part of a word.
The whole text can be represented with one word and that's it.
Input: A string.

Output: A string.

Example:

first_word("Hello world") == "Hello"
first_word("greetings, friends") == "greetings" """

    """
        returns the first word in a given text.
